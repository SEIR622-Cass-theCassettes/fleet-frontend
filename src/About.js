                <h3>What is Fleet?</h3>
                <p>Fleet is a modern method for businesses to manage their vehicles. Using our software allows customers to keep track of important information on their fleet vehicles. This includes when services are due. Users can also add notes in order for employees to report any issues on said vehicles or to keep track of required repairs.</p>
                <h3>Is Fleet Right For Me?</h3>
                <p>Our software can help a company of any size mange their vehicles in a more orderly fashion.</p>
                <h3>Why Is Fleet Right For Me?</h3>
                <p>Have any of your company's trucks ever gone past their service date? This can cause expensive repairs to be required. With Fleet your vehicles can be managed much easier and you no longer have to worry about Bob losing the sticky note that had the mileage of the last oil change scribbled on it. It's okay Bob, we forgive you this time. Our note taking capabilities allow all of the important information about your vehicles to be kept in one place. If your services are conducted in house simply add a note with the oil filters part number and the oil weight so its always on hand.</p>
                <h3>How Much Is Fleet?</h3>
                <p>As much as you're willing to pay me.</p>
